These are our drums
This is our melody
Da da da da da da da da-ah-ah
Now listen closely as our drums
become our melody
And here's our song:
Da da da da da da da da-ah-ah
Da da da da da da da-ah
Da da da da da da da da-ah-ah
Da da da da da da da-ah-ah
So let me play my violin for you
The truth is that I'm screwed
Still Joe,
do you think I'm cool?
I got friends
in a lotta weird places
Wonder if they're gonna call
depending what my face is
I got friends
in a lotta weird places
Wonder if they're gonna call
depending what my face is
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Humpty Dumpty
When Humpty Dumpty
When Humpty Dumpty went down
He said screw it
Imma smile right through it
And I'll scream
when no one's around
Humpty Dumpty
When Humpty Dumpty
When Humpty Dumpty went down
He said screw it
Im'a smile right through it
And I'll scream when no one,
when no one,
when no one's around
Da da da da da da da da-ah-ah
Da da da da da da da-ah
(And I'll scream when no one,
when no one,
when no one's around)
One day, maybe someday
I'll be so out of touch
I'll become a trumpet or
a drumset
In a sad orchestra
One day, maybe someday
In a world speeding up
It's getting hard,
so very hard to keep up
One day, maybe someday
I'll be so out of touch
I'll become a trumpet or
a drumset
In a sad orchestra
One day
I won't know what to write
And I can't be eighteen
my whole life
But I'm too fucking young
To feel so fucking old
But I'll try and I'll try
and I'll try...
But I'm not dead yet so I guess
I'll be alright
Bang, bang, bang
But I'm way less sad
Adventure is out there
Come on guy
Bang, bang, bang
But it's all I have
But I'm not dead yet so I guess
I'll be alright
